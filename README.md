# CO2 Meter (mqtt)

![main-image](raw.githubusercontent.com/de1m/co2-meter-mqtt/master/co2-lampe-main-crop.jpg)

## Description

In this project I've created a co2 sesor (mh-z19) with connection to a mqtt broker, so you cann send the co2 data to a mqtt broker. 

I've used the esp8266 12e version. 

Folder structure:
firmware - all files, that you do need to flash your esp8266 12e
pcb - board schema, pdfs. Imprtant: for the board you need a usb-connection board (show image board_top.jpg)
3d-models - 3d models for 3d printer, so you can print a case for pcb.
